## Moderation
This paper is written about my other project [MatrixLib][matrixlib_repo].
Moderation at Bard College is the official process of declaring one's major. 
Since I am entering into both Math and Computer Science, I decided that MatrixLib would be a perfect project to write about.

I created this repository in order to have some sort of version control on my paper.
Being one of the first large papers I have written in LaTeX, I will be able to see how my writing and familiarity with LaTeX has changed over time.
I will also keep the paper's PDF within the repository as well. Feel free to take a read!
