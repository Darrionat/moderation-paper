MatrixLib is a free, open-source library for Java developers who want to easily make linear algebraic computations.
I, Darrion, wanted to start creating this project while I was taking MATH 242 (Elementary Linear Algebra) at Bard College.
This new branch of math piqued my interest, and with its extreme usage in the field of programming, I knew creating MatrixLib would be a great way to learn even more about linear algebra and mathematical computation.
MatrixLib is built with Maven, a tool that manages building projects.
Using Maven makes MatrixLib all the easier to implement due to Maven's dependency management.
Installation instructions can be found on the page of the repository (\href{https://github.com/Darrionat/MatrixLib}{https://github.com/Darrionat/MatrixLib}).
In addition, MatrixLib is independent software; therefore, it has no dependencies besides Java itself.
MatrixLib is designed around ease of use, and continues to be a tool that I use for various computations.
